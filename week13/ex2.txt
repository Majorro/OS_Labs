Deadlock recovery: can be better used when the deadlock chance is low because this approach spends more resources
in comparison with other ones.

Deadlock prevention: can be better used when deadlock chance is high,
in these cases is still better than recovery in spite of low throughput.

Deadlock avoidance: fits when enough information aboutr the safeness of the system state is known.
